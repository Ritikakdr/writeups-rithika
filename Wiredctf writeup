## WIRED CTF
CRYPTOGRAPHY
life timesettlement:
A text was given, At first I thought it should get converted from binary to text form. But then after many attempts i tried analysing the cipher. I got to know that it was spoon

And the flag was:wired{0nc3_ap0n_a_t1m3_th3r3_L1ved_a_g0st_V1kr4m}

Caesar cipher:
I had to figure out the given cipher text, so used a online cipher decoder and got the flag :wired{a_g3nt1n_w1ll_1n}

da_french_cipher:
The french cipher also known as vigenere cipher, converting the text to vigenere cipher I got the flag.wired{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_w0rld_0f_c1ph3rs}

WIRELESS
Chan’s favourite:
An audio file was given,I used Audacity,uploaded the audio there and changed it from waveform to spectogram and found Rick Astley’s picture in it. The flag was Rick Astley

Dots and Dashes:
An audio file was given , as the name suggests dots and dashes its a morse code, so I uploaded the audio file on a online morse code audio decoder and got the flagC T F R 1 C K R 0 1 1 3 D O N M R S 3

OSINT:
find_thyself:
A image file was given , A power socket of bticino

The flag was the country’s name, that is Italy.

REVERSING
grep_it:
I used the grep command to find the flag in the file , * cat < file name > | grep -a < word > *

grep_it:
same as the before one
